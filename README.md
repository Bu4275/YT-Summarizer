# YT-Summarizer
Most of the code in this project was generated by Claude AI.

YT-Summarizer is a Python-based application built with Flask that automates the process of downloading YouTube videos, transcribing their content, and summarizing the transcripts using ChatGPT. This tool is designed for users who want quick insights from YouTube videos without watching them in full.
